好的，遵照您的指示。我将依照 [[海明威英文写作的“四大原则”]]，对您关于“有效运用新工具”的笔记进行优化，使其更简洁、直接、有力。

### **Use New Tools Well**

New tools come fast. They can help you. They can also slow you.
Use them right. Make them work for you.
These are the rules.

---

### **1. Minimalist Tech Stack**

Too many tools confuse you. They waste your time. Build a simple system.

*   **Principle:** Less is more. A tool must add value. It must not take your focus.
    *   Net benefit = (output increase) - (cognitive/time cost).

*   **Method:**
    *   **One tool, one job.** Do not use three apps for one task. This saves your mind. It stops `information fragmentation`. It cuts `context switching cost`.
    *   **Go deep.** Master two tools. Do not learn a little about ten. Use `depth-over-breadth`.
    *   **Cut the fat.** Remove tools you do not use. Keep your system strong. Do `continuous auditing`.

---

### **2. Act First. Organize Later.**

Do not wait to act. Do not organize before you start. Action comes first.

*   **Principle:** Act. Then organize. Do not get stuck in planning. Avoid `internal friction`.

*   **Method:**
    *   **Write ideas fast.** Do not sort them now. Capture everything. Sort it later. This is `instant capture`.
    *   **Start small.** Write a bad first draft. Do not aim for perfect. Ship it. This is `minimum viable action`.
    *   **Let order grow.** Your system will form from your work. Do not force it. This is `emergent organization`.

---

### **3. Build Your Rhythm**

Do not chase perfect. Chase steady. Build habits that last.

*   **Principle:** Rhythm is better than detail. A steady pace wins. It lowers `activation cost`.

*   **Method:**
    *   **Make loops.** Do small, daily tasks. Do not track every minute. Design `sustainable loops`.
    *   **Be consistent.** Do not break. If you break, start again fast. Focus on `macro-consistency`.
    *   **Save energy.** Habits make work easy. Do not waste thought on small choices. Prioritize `energy management`.

### **4. Tools That Make You Smart**

Your tools can do more. They can make you think better. They can make you smarter.

*   **Principle:** A tool must make your mind stronger. It must not just store facts. It must `feed cognition`.

*   **Method:**
    *   **Turn facts into ideas.** Connect notes. Find new links. See hidden truths. This is `knowledge alchemy`.
    *   **Force yourself to think.** Use templates for review. Ask hard questions. Use `forced reflection frameworks`.
    *   **Draw your thoughts.** Use maps. See your ideas. Find the weak spots. Fix your thinking. This is `visualizing mental models`. Your tool becomes a `cognitive enhancement tool`.
