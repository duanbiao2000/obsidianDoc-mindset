# Statistical Report: Analysis of 8 Specialized AI Models

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes 8 distinct categories of specialized AI models, examining their architectures, purposes, and relationships. The analysis is based on key dimensions including input types, processing structures, and output formats.

## 1. Model Classification Overview

### 1.1 Classification Rationale
- Task-specific focus differentiation
- Distinct input/processing/output patterns

### 1.2 Model Categories Summary
1. Large Language Models (LLM)
2. Language-Conditioned Models (LCM) 
3. Language-Augmented Models (LAM)
4. Mixture of Experts (MoE)
5. Vision Language Models (VLM)
6. Speech Language Models (SLM)
7. Masked Language Models (MLM)
8. Segment Anything Models (SAM)

## 2. Detailed Model Analysis

### 2.1 Large Language Models (LLM)
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based (Encoder-only/Decoder-only)
- **Input**: Token Embeddings
- **Output**: Language generation
- **Key Examples**: GPT, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini
- **Primary Applications**: General language tasks (Q&A, summarization, dialogue)

### 2.2 Language-Conditioned Models (LCM)
- **Architecture**: Cross-attention connecting language and non-language
- **Input**: Text prompts + other modalities
- **Output**: Non-language (video, images, control signals)
- **Core Function**: Language-driven multimodal generation

### 2.3 Language-Augmented Models (LAM)
- **Architecture**: Language embeddings in non-language processing
- **Input**: Joint language & other modalities
- **Output**: Fused representations or control signals
- **Applications**: Image Q&A, multimodal understanding, medical imaging

### 3.2 Key Findings
1. **Structural Evolution**
   - Trend from unified language processing to specialized architectures
   - Example: SAM's three-branch structure, MoE's sparse activation

2. **Multimodal Integration**
   - Growing emphasis on language × image/action/space reasoning
   - Evident in LCM, LAM, VLM, SAM architectures

3. **Future Development Trajectory**
   - Necessity of language-perception model fusion
   - Development of complete perception → representation → reasoning → execution pipelines
